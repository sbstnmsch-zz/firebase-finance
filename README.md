# Google Firebase Finance App
This small web-app uses Google's Firebase API.

Keep track of your monthly average expenses by entering each
expense you made, i.e. 5 EUR for a beer you just paid.

Point your smartphone to http://beer-count.sebastian-misch.de
and add it to your home-screen (iOS) or bookmark it on Android.
